  <h1>Rice</h1>
  <p>Not all rice is created equal. If you're going to buy anything from Whole Foods, it should be rice. I personally like the brown short grain.</p>
  <p>This is more of a technique than a recipe and it is inspired by the time I spent living in Brazil. These instructions are for making 1 cup of rice which is good for ~2 people. Decreasing or increasing is simple: 1 part rice, slightly more than 2 parts water</p>

  <h3>Required</h3>

  <ul>
    <li>Water</li>
    <li>A few tbsp of ex vg olive oil</li>
    <li>1 cup of rice</li>
    <li>6 cloves of Garlic</li>
    <li>1/3 Onion</li>
    <li>Salt &amp; Pepper</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Instruction</h3>

  <ol>
    <li>Start heating the water to boil in a kettle</li>
    <li>Finely chop garlic and onion</li>
    <li>In a sauce pan heat olive oil over medium high</li>
    <li>Mix in garlic and onion and sautee until brown, about 3 minutes</li>
    <li>Mix in dry rice to season the rice. Stir rapidly for about 5 minutes. It should be almost burning</li>
    <li>Pour in water, give it one stir, and wait for it to boil. Put a lid on it</li>
    <li>Set to a low simmer and cook slowly until all water is gone - about 45 minutes</li>
    <li>Once ready, add salt and pepper, fold over and serve</li>
  </ol>

  <h3>Considerations</h3>

  <ul>
    <li>When checking water levels, be careful not to stir the rice. Slightly move the rice to the side to see the bottom. As soon as you stir the rice, it's over</li>
    <li>If the rice isn't ready, add a little water and keep it going</li>
    <li>If you're in more of a rush, you can add more water and cook at a slightly higher heat. This is sort of a balancing act that you'll need to feel out</li>
  </ul>
